This program appears to be designed to search a directory and its subdirectories for files of a specified media type, 
and then check the contents of each file to determine if it is of a type specified by the user. If the file matches one of the user-specified media types, 
the program will print some information about the file, such as its name and location, as well as the contents of the first 32 bytes of the file.
Users will need to create txt file corresponding to the contents in media list user_media_interest for specified file filtered binary signatures
